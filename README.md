# Deep_Q_Learning_for_Lunar_Landing
A Deep Q-Learning agent implementation for solving the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI's Gym. This project demonstrates reinforcement learning in action by training an agent to land a lunar module safely. Includes customizable hyperparameters, experience replay, and epsilon-greedy exploration.
